      Prior cases of flooding in the Monterey County area are a result of various factors, and typically manifest into different types of flooding that affect different areas and communities.
    </p>

    <p id="second_sentence">
      One type of flooding that has impacted the area in the past is coastal flooding, which is when excessive water from coastal regions, those being the ocean or estuaries, gets deposited in areas of dry land. This water is commonly displaced in such a manner due to changing conditions in tidal patterns, which could be in turn caused by many factors. Severe storms at sea, a changing climate, or changes in ocean currents can lead to these events. Such events, and the consequent flooding, has been noted to be more common around winter months, typically from November to around February.
    </p>

    <p id="third_sentence">
      While the coast can play a large role in the ways water affects Monterey County, it is not the only source where excess water can lead to the flooding of residential areas, roads, or agricultural fields. Flooding also commonly occurs due to the overflowing of rivers and streams. In the past, the Salinas river has been frequently noted as one of the water sources that could have drastic impacts on communities if flooding were to get severe. One of the reasons for why these rivers and streams overflow is due to intensive and consistent rainfall patterns that build up water reserves across multiple stream systems in a watershed. This build up eventually flows down the watershed and is poured into a single river, which then overflows.
    </p>

    <p id="fourth_sentence">
      A particularly dangerous form of flooding is flash flooding, which as the name implies, is the flooding of an area at alarming rates. Flash floods typically transpire quickly, so predicting where and when flash floods holds a huge advantage as opposed to simply reacting to their occurrence. Flash floods are notably more devastating and fierce than other types of flooding, wielding the power to decimate buildings, uproot trees, demolish powerlines, and erode agricultural land. Some ways in which flash floods are predicted is in the monitoring of intensive and long rainfall patterns or in the steepness of water levels across a watershed.
    </p>

    <p id="fifth_sentence">
      While nature plays a huge role in water systems and flood patterns, it would be disingenuous to ignore human impacts and human made flooding. Human water systems involving pipes have finite space and could be prone to overfilling and thus, small floods would occur throughout the county. These floods are typically seen at smaller scales, and might result in the closure of areas, buildings, or roads. However, more severe cases of larger property destruction should not be ruled out.
