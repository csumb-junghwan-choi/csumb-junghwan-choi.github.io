      Flooding and severe storms could heavily impact your home if you are not prepared. However, with a couple of preparations, the safety of your home can be greatly improved and damage is less likely to occur. Itâ€™s important to note that not all of the following preparations and precautions might be needed for your particular situation, and that the circumstances under which you are in will change the types of preparations you should make. 
    </p>

    <p id="example">
      A great way to ensure that your home is safe and prepared is to ensure the quality of your pipes and drainage systems. Keeping these systems in ideal conditions is a key way to help prevent the risks of leaks and indoor flooding. Another method for preventing water from getting into your home is the use of sandbags, although this method is typically only used for specific situations where evacuation is not necessary, but flooding and water flow will be reaching your home. Sandbags should be around a third to half full of sand and be placed in stacks. They are commonly used to block drainage, doors, or other low lying areas where water can potentially seep through. It should be noted that sandbags are not a foolproof method for stopping water flow, and should be used in conjunction with other methods.
