    <h2>Preparing for Evacuation</h2>

    <p id="preparing-p">
      A great way to begin preparing for a potential evacuation is to register for local emergency alerts. Make sure to communicate with friends and family about how you will respond to an evacuation, such as where everyone plans to meet, and what different routes or modes of transportation everyone can take. If you have pets living with you, be sure to plan how they will be transported and which places can accommodate them. Contacting the <a href="https://www.spcamc.org/" target="_blank">SPCA of Monterey County</a> is a good idea for obtaining more information. Be safe and alert when driving, avoid flooded areas and follow recommended evacuation routes. Be sure to dress comfortably, enduring shoes will be a great help.

        After preparing supplies, staying alert on the situation of flooding in the area is very important. A reliable way to stay alert would be to pay attention to news sources that keep track of weather, one of which is <a href="https://www.ksbw.com/" target="_blank">KSBW8</a>. They have relevant information on weather conditions that is updated consistently and they cover reports across Monterey County. Their website is easily accessible, and they can also be found on various social media apps, such as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ksbw_8/?hl=en" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.

      <p class="flex-p">
        Another useful resource is the <a href="https://montereyco.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=905a9458324b4868804d96b5593eb978" target="_blank">Monterey County Maps Arc Gis App</a>. This site is updated regularly and provides topical information in relation to flooding, including whether areas are under evacuation, not at risk for evacuation, or in an evacuation warning phase. The map also includes information on shelters, road closures, and sandbag stockpiles in Monterey County. Having the link to this site bookmarked or easily accessible on a mobile phone is a great way of ensuring you will know when the proper time to evacuate will be.
