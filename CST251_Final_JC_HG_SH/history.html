      <p id="opening">
        Monterey County has documentation of flooding for decades, and while it’s not a yearly cycle, it is notable enough to see consistent trends. First hand accounts of flooding and the effects of severe storms go as far back as 1911, where storms severely impacted several agricultural fields and the area of Spreckels experienced some flooding. The time of year for when these severe storms and flooding occur fits a general trend. Most of these events occur during the winter and spring months, commonly during the beginning of the year.

      <p class="year-info">
        In 2019 an atmospheric river was the cause for increased rains and storms, which would ultimately lead to roadway flooding. The storms also brought stronger winds, as well as a flash flood which impacted Chualar, which caused the flooding of various homes and a highway, with around 2 million dollars in damages.

      <p class="year-info">
        In 2016 Monterey County was vastly affected by storms that coincided with the El Niño winter. These major storms occurred on three separate occasions, the first taking place in January, and the second two occurrences during the month of March. Flooding and storms caused damage to several roadways, where many had to be temporarily closed and cost around seven million dollars in repairs.
