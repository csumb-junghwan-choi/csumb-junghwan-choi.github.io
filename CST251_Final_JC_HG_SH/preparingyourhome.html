        Flooding and severe storms could heavily impact your home and safety if you are not prepared. Ensuring that a couple of preparations are made could lead to the safety of your home and decreasing the amount of damage done. Itâ€™s important to note that the precautions that should be taken vary by situation and location.

        A great way to ensure that your home is safe and prepared is to ensure the quality of your pipes and drainage systems. Doing so will help prevent the risks of leaks and indoor flooding. Another precaution is to use sandbags, although this method is typically only used for when evacuation is not necessary, but water might reach your home. Sandbags should be around a third to half full and be placed in stacks. Use them to block drainage, doors, and other low lying areas where water can potentially seep through. It should be noted that sandbags are not a foolproof method for stopping water flow, and should be used in conjunction with other methods.
