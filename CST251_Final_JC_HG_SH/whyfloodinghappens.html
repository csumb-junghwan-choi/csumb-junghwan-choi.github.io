    <h1>Why Flooding Happens</h1>

    <p id="intro_sentence">
      Prior cases of flooding in Monterey County have been a result of various factors, and typically manifest into various types of flooding that affect different areas and communities.
    </p>

    <h2>Coastal Flooding</h2>
    
    <div class="row">
      <p class="flood-p">
        One type of flooding that has impacted the area in the past is coastal flooding, which is when excess water from coastal regions floods further inland. This water is commonly displaced due to changing conditions in tidal patterns, which could be caused by many factors. Severe storms at sea, the effects of climate change, or shifts in ocean currents can lead to these events. Such events have been noted to be more common around winter months, typically around late November to early February.

    <h2>River Flooding</h2>
    
    <div class="row">
      <p class="flood-p">
        While the coast can play a large role in the ways water affects Monterey County, it is not the only source where excess water can lead to flooding. Another way flooding commonly occurs by is the overflowing of rivers and streams. In the past, the Salinas River has been frequently noted as one of the water sources that could have drastic impacts on communities if flooding were to get severe. One of the reasons for why these rivers and streams overflow is due to intensive and consistent rainfall patterns that build up water reserves across multiple streams. This build up eventually flows down the watershed and is poured into a single river, causing it to overflow.

    <h2>Flash Flooding</h2>
    
    <div class="row">
      <p class="flood-p">
        A particularly dangerous form of flooding is flash flooding, a flood that fills an area at an alarming rate. Flash floods typically transpire quickly, so predicting where and when flash floods will occur holds a huge advantage as opposed to simply reacting to theim. Flash floods are notably more devastating and fierce than other types of flooding, wielding the power to decimate buildings, uproot trees, demolish powerlines, and erode agricultural land. Some ways in which flash floods are predicted is through the monitoring of intensive and long rainfall patterns or in the steepness of water levels across a watershed.

    <h2>Human-Caused Flooding</h2>
    
    <div class="row">
      <p class="flood-p">
        Although nature plays a huge role in water systems and flood patterns, it would be disingenuous to ignore human impacts and human-caused flooding. Human water systems involving pipes have finite space and can be prone to overfilling, thus causing small floods to occur throughout the county. These floods are typically seen at smaller scales, and might result in the closure of areas, buildings, or roads. However, more severe cases of larger property destruction should not be ruled out.
